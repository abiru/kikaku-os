I noticed `scripts/codex-run.sh` already has uncommitted changes I didn’t make (e.g., work-commit logic, new flags, removal of `--commit-storefront`). I only added a small safety tweak (`git add --` for scoped staging and run dir).  
How would you like to proceed: keep the existing edits and include them in the patch, or reset to HEAD and re-apply only the required changes?
