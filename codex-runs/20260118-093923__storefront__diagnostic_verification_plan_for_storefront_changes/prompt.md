Create a minimal verification plan that is diagnostic (helps pinpoint failures quickly).
Deliver:

- 5-10 ordered shell commands (copy/paste ready).
- After each command, add a short success criterion (1 clause).
- Add up to 5 failure-mode follow-ups (1 line each).
  Focus on: Astro build/preview, client-only rendering regressions on /products, routing for /products/[id], global.css/layout padding effects, vitest wiring.
  Constraints: no long prose; each step <= 1 line explanation. No assumptions about backend/Stripe availability.
